                        <p>Our boy Ollie spent two nights with Victor. Ollie came back happy and wagging his tail!
                            Ollie requires a lot of walks and attention and we are happy to say that all of his needs were met.
                            We look forward to using Victor's services again soon!

                        <p>Victor is an experienced pet owner, he is very knowledgeable and extremely patient.
                            I absolutely trust him with my pets. They receive the best care ever!
                            Nothing greater than a piece of mind knowing that your babies are safe and happy!

                        <p>Victor and his wife really love dogs. We boarded our growing puppy, Charlie, with them twice.
                            Charlie is still working on his training but Victor enthusiastically welcomes his puppy excitement.
                            Victor sends us picture updates of walks, park visits, nap time, and playing time.
                            Charlie is happy to go to Victor's house, which gives us peace of mind.
                            We are happy to have Victor as part of our tool belt to give the best care to Charlie.
